# Resume Categorization Using Machine Learning

## Description

In the present competitive labor market, the amount of resumes organizations receive frequently needs to be increased in the traditional recruitment processes. Manual resume screening is time-consuming, resulting in inefficient candidate selection. To overcome these issues, this research provides a novel framework for resume categorization that employs machine learning (ML) approaches. 

Using ML techniques boosts the efficiency of resume classification by swiftly and precisely processing many resumes. The performance of the model is further increased by the inclusion of advanced NLP models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which helps in capturing complex phrases and text embeddings. The trained model is evaluated using metrics that include Recall, Accuracy, Precision, and F1 score. The accuracy of 99.48% by the machine learning model proves the efficient classification of resumes. Using these techniques enhances resume classification and lowers the burden on recruiters, thus helping recruiters in their decision-making.

- ## Methodology

The methodology for this project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather a diverse set of resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
   - Annotate the resumes with relevant categories (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Project Manager).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert resumes to a consistent format (text extraction from PDF/DOCX).
   - Clean and preprocess the text data (remove stop words, punctuation, etc.).
   - Tokenize the text data and create embeddings using NLP techniques.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Use advanced NLP models like BERT to extract text embeddings.
   - Capture complex phrases and contextual information from the resumes.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) on the training set.
   - Fine-tune the models to improve performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained models using metrics such as Recall, Accuracy, Precision, and F1 score.
   - Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.

- ## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a significant advancement in the field of automated resume screening by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques. With an impressive accuracy of 99.48%, the proposed framework effectively classifies resumes, thereby reducing the burden on recruiters and enhancing the overall efficiency of the recruitment process. The integration of BERT further improves the model's ability to understand and process complex text data, making this solution highly effective and reliable for real-world applications.
